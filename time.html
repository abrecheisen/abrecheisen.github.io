    <p>The assignment was to create an
animation using Adobe Animate. I loved
making my animation even though
it wasn’t necessarily a success. The
animation is of my raster image: the
woman still preoccupied with reading
on her lily pad. The vector octopus
emerges from behind, but instead of
pulling her down into the water, wiggles
around playfully. Tragedy was only
narrowly avoided because I couldn’t
animate the pull-down to my satisfaction.
The unintended outcome ended
up serving as a suitable metaphor for
how, despite my ever-present existential
dread, life is still wondrous and
there is much joy to be found.</p>
