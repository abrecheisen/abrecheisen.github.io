    <p>The assignment was to use Adobe InDesign to create an eight-page layout for print featuring all of our class assignments. I enjoyed reviewing all of my work with a critical eye and putting my thought process into words. The last assignment was to complete this website using the code editor, Brackets. This was my first time using HTML and CSS and I loved the experience. I am so excited for the opportunity to learn more! VMD 105 has been a very useful class and I would recommend it to anyone interest in Visual Media Design. </p>
