    <p>The assignment was to create a creature
using Adobe Illustrator. I utilized my raster
project and added an octopus to the
scene. It was intimidating because I
didnâ€™t have any experience drawing or
illustrating. The perspective is off, and
the octopus is more cartoonish than
intended, but I was happy with the result.
The octopus represents the spectre
of time that creeps up when we fail
to pay attention to our surroundings.
My final image is in portrait orientation,
so I have also included part of my
original sketch which is more sinister
than the illustrated version.</p>
