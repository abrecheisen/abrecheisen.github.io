    <p>The assignment was to create a “selfie” using Adobe Photoshop. I really enjoyed the challenge.  I created a composite of a woman reading in a whimsical setting. The image is meant to show my greatest strength and greatest weakness: I have a deep sense of wonder and imagination but when I look up from my dreams, so much of life seems to have passed me by. This gives me a feeling of unreality, or of life being a dream within a dream. But, even then, as the rest of the poem states, noticing the passing of time does not make it any less gone.</p>
